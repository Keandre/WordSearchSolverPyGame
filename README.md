# WordSearchSolverPyGame
Have a word search and a list of words, and this program will display it solved for you.

## How to Use it

1. Have a word search, separated by line.

e.g.

"abc
def
ghi"

2. Have a list of words, also separated by line
3. Run and enjoy your word search completely solved


## Current Bugs
1. Having a 1 letter word breaks the program.
2. Having only one word, and that word not being a match creates a blank screen.
